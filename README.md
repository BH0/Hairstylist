# Hairstylist 
* A React [Static] web-page. 
* Generated as "React-Static - Blank Example" 

### To Deploy/Host [using Github Pages] 
1. Make sure none of the files that the "built website" will require are open 
2. Type "react-static build" in command line 
    - This will produce a folder in the project directory called "dist" 
3. I assume you have created a repository [if not create one, it can be the project's source code's repository or a sperate repository] 
4. Ensure the "dist" folder is in your appropriate Github repository 
5. Go to the repository's settings and under "Github Pages" change the Source to "dist" then click "save" 
6. Navigate to the genereated link [it will be displayed in the same "Github Pages" section you were just at] and ensure your website is live
